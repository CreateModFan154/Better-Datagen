# Minecraft Datagen Python Script

A lightweight Python script to automatically generate Minecraft block, item, and blockstate JSONs based on your Java mod source.  
Designed to save hours of manual JSON creation.

---

## Features

- Scans Java source for registry entries automatically.
- Generates:
  - Blockstates
  - Block models
  - Item models
- Detects whether an entry is a block or an item based on texture availability.
- Fully customizable templates for models and blockstates.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Basic understanding of your mod structure and `MODID`
- Place your textures in the appropriate folders:
  - `assets/<MODID>/textures/block/`
  - `assets/<MODID>/textures/item/`

---

## Usage

1. Set `MODID`, `JAVA_SOURCE`, and `OUTPUT_ASSETS` in the script.
2. Place your textures in the corresponding block/item folders.
3. Run the script:

```python datagen.py```

JSON files will be generated automatically in your assets folder.

## Example
Suppose you have a block iron_pipe:

- Place iron_pipe.png in assets/<MODID>/textures/block/

- Run the script

- Result:

  - blockstates/iron_pipe.json

  - models/block/iron_pipe.json

  - models/item/iron_pipe.json

Pull requests are welcome!
**Do not relicense the Python script itself** — you may freely use and license any generated output.

## Notes
* The script assumes a simple block/item structure.
* For advanced templates (trims, layered items), consider customizing the template functions in the script.
